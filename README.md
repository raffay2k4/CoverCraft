# CoverCraft
CoverCraft is a chatbot designed to streamline the Upwork application process by generating personalized cover letters tailored to individual job posts. Built using LangChain and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, it dynamically crafts responses based on your skills, certifications, and experience.

Users can create their profiles by submitting a JSON file through a FastAPI backend endpoint, enabling the chatbot to reference their background when writing relevant, customized cover letters.
